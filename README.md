*Python Mode built for Processing 4 alpha*

For anybody who wants to help test this. To report bugs or find out more:

1. Download this file: https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-for-processing-4/raw/main/PythonMode-4.0a4.zip
2. Extract it and place the PythonMode directory in your sketchbook *modes* directory (see **File > Preferences** menu in Processing for this location). Replace any existing PythonMode files.

If you're running Processing 3 and 4 on the same system, they both use the same sketchbook directory (but this build seems to work fine in both).
